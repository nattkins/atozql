            <p class="page-hero-sub">DORA requires every EU financial entity to maintain a live register of ICT
                third-party dependencies — 15 templates, 100+ fields, 116 validation rules. The current approach?
                Spreadsheets filled in quarterly by people who don't know the answers. ZQL federates the Register from
                live systems. The RoI becomes a Q³ instrument — traceable, auditable, and impossible to game.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="content-inner">
            <div class="section-label">The Problem</div>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Register of Information Is a Soviet Exercise</h2>

            <p>DORA's Register of Information is 15 templates organised into 7 functional groups. It maps every ICT
                third-party provider, every contract, every subcontractor, every business function dependent on external
                technology. It requires LEI validation, supply chain depth mapping, concentration risk identification,
                and cross-referencing across all templates.</p>

            <p>Here's what actually happens: a compliance officer emails department heads asking them to fill in a
                spreadsheet. The department heads forward it to someone junior. That person guesses. The spreadsheet
                goes back up the chain. Nobody validates the LEIs. Nobody checks the subcontractor chains. Nobody maps
                the concentration risks. The Register passes initial submission because the format is correct — but the
                content is fiction.</p>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>This is The Soviet archetype in action.</strong> The centre demands the Register. The edge
                    fills it in to survive the audit, not to tell the truth. The centre can't verify because they don't
                    have visibility into the actual systems. Everyone knows the Register is incomplete, but the game
                    rewards submission over accuracy.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Template B_05.01 — the ICT Third-Party Service Provider master list — is where most organisations fail.
                It requires valid LEIs (checked against GLEIF), parent undertaking chains, country-of-data-processing
                for every provider, annual expense figures, and subcontractor flags. Most organisations don't even know
                who their fourth-party providers are, let alone their LEIs.</p>

    <section class="content-section alt-bg">
        <div class="content-inner">
            <div class="section-label">The ZQL Approach</div>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Federate the Register From Live Systems</h2>

            <p>Instead of asking humans to fill in spreadsheets, ZQL federates the Register of Information from the
                systems that already contain the data: contract management systems, CMDBs, vendor portals, risk
                registers, and procurement platforms.</p>

            <div class="two-col">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>ZQL adapters connect (read-only) to your existing systems. The DORA lens maps each system's
                        native data onto the 15-template structure. Where data is missing or inconsistent, ZQL surfaces
                        the gap rather than hiding it — because a known gap is manageable, while an unknown gap is a
                        liability.</p>
                    <p>The Register isn't generated once and filed. It's a live federation — every query pulls current
                        data from source systems. When a contract changes, the Register reflects it. When a
                        subcontractor relationship shifts, the concentration risk map updates. When an LEI lapses, the
                        validation catches it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>What Changes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Before:</strong> Quarterly spreadsheet exercise. Department heads guess. Compliance
                        formats. Nobody validates. Everyone pretends.</p>
                    <p><strong>After:</strong> Live federated register. Data pulled from source systems. Gaps surfaced
                        automatically. Concentration risks computed from actual dependency graphs, not self-reported
                        assessments. Every answer traceable to the system that produced it.</p>
                    <p>The Register becomes what DORA intended: a live map of ICT dependency. Not a compliance document.
                        A management instrument.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison — left showing the "before" (spreadsheet chaos, email chains, manual entry), right showing the "after" (live dependency graph federated from CMDB, contract system, vendor portal) -->

            <div class="callout-box gold">
                <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> DORA doesn't just require a Register — it requires that the
                    Register be accurate. Article 28(3) mandates that financial entities "identify and assess" ICT
                    concentration risk. You can't assess what you can't see. Federation makes the invisible visible.</p>

    <!-- ========== CONCENTRATION RISK ========== -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="content-inner">
            <div class="section-label">The Hidden Risk</div>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Concentration Risk Is a Graph Problem</h2>

            <p>Your organisation uses Microsoft 365. Your payment processor uses Azure. Your CRM runs on Azure. Your
                data warehouse runs on Azure. Your third-party risk platform runs on Azure. You've reported five
                separate ICT arrangements — but you have one concentration risk: Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Now go deeper. Microsoft's data centres are hosted by Equinix. Your backup provider also uses Equinix.
                Your disaster recovery site uses Equinix. Three apparently independent providers share a single
                fourth-party dependency that nobody mapped because nobody looked past the first tier.</p>

            <!-- IMAGE: The ICT dependency graph from the DORA demo — showing the network with Equinix as a critical concentration node, multiple paths converging -->

            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>ZQL computes concentration risk from the actual dependency graph</strong> — not from
                    self-reported assessments. It traverses third-party and fourth-party relationships, identifies
                    convergence points, and flags concentration risks that wouldn't be visible from any single system's
                    perspective. This is a Q³ operation: the answer depends not just on the data (Q¹) or the context
                    (Q²) but on the game being played between parties who may not want their dependencies known.</p>
