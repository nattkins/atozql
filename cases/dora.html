            <p class="case-lede">DORA requires every EU financial entity to maintain a live Register of Information
                mapping all ICT third-party dependencies. Fifteen templates, 100+ fields, 116 validation rules. The
                current approach: a compliance officer emails department heads asking them to fill in a spreadsheet. The
                department heads forward it to someone junior. That person guesses. The Register passes because the
                format is correct. The content is fiction.</p>

            <h2>The Soviet Exercise</h2>
            <p>This is the Soviet archetype in action. The centre demands the Register. The edge fills it in to survive
                the audit, not to tell the truth. The centre can't verify because they don't have visibility into the
                actual systems. Everyone knows the Register is incomplete. The game rewards submission over accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>Template B_05.01 — the ICT Third-Party Service Provider master list — is where most organisations fail.
                It requires valid LEIs checked against the GLEIF database, parent undertaking chains,
                country-of-data-processing for every provider, annual expense figures, and subcontractor flags. 60% of
                all validation failures occur here. Most organisations don't even know who their fourth-party providers
                are, let alone their LEIs.</p>

            <h2>Concentration Risk Is a Graph Problem</h2>
            <p>Your organisation uses Microsoft 365. Your payment processor uses Azure. Your CRM runs on Azure. Your
                data warehouse runs on Azure. Your third-party risk platform runs on Azure. You've reported five
                separate ICT arrangements — but you have one concentration risk: Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Now go deeper. Microsoft's data centres are hosted by Equinix. Your backup provider also uses Equinix.
                Your disaster recovery site uses Equinix. Three apparently independent providers share a single
                fourth-party dependency that nobody mapped because nobody looked past the first tier.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Article 28(5) requires concentration risk assessment. You can't assess what you can't see. A
                    spreadsheet can list your vendors. Only a federated system can traverse the graph and show you where
                    they converge.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Federation Does</h2>
            <p>Instead of asking humans to fill in spreadsheets, ZQL federates the Register of Information from the
                systems that already contain the data. Read-only adapters connect to contract management, CMDB, vendor
                portal, and procurement systems. The DORA lens maps each system's native data onto the 15-template
                structure. Where data is missing or inconsistent, ZQL surfaces the gap rather than hiding it — because a
                known gap is manageable, while an unknown gap is a liability.</p>
            <p>The Register isn't generated once and filed. It's a live federation — every query pulls current data from
                source systems. When a contract changes, the Register reflects it. When a subcontractor relationship
                shifts, the concentration risk map updates. When an LEI lapses, the validation catches it.</p>

            <h2>What the Regulator Will Ask</h2>
            <p>When the ESAs review your Register, they won't just check format compliance. They'll ask five questions:
                Have you documented ALL ICT third-party arrangements? Have you mapped subcontractor chains with
                rank-in-chain? Have you identified concentration risks where multiple arrangements converge? Is this
                Register current or was it accurate six months ago? And — can you show where each data point came from?
            </p>
            <p>A spreadsheet can answer the first question, badly. Only a federated system can answer the other four.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>The Register becomes what DORA intended: a live map of ICT dependency. Not a compliance document. A
                    management instrument. The difference isn't format — it's whether you can stand behind the answer
                    when the auditor asks "where did this come from?"</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Eight Weeks to a Live Register</h2>
            <p><strong>Weeks 1–2:</strong> System mapping. Identify which systems contain contract data, provider
                information, and service dependencies. Map to DORA template structure. Identify gaps before touching any
                technology.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 3–4:</strong> Adapter deployment. Read-only connections to contract management, CMDB,
                vendor portal, and procurement systems. No data moves — ZQL queries in place.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 5–6:</strong> Register federation. DORA lens maps source data to all 15 templates.
                Validation rules applied. Gaps surfaced. Concentration risk graph computed.</p>
            <p><strong>Weeks 7–8:</strong> Compliance review. Live Register demonstrated to compliance team. Gap
                remediation prioritised. Export to ESA submission format. Ongoing federation maintained.</p>
            <p>Compare: traditional approach takes 6–12 months, produces a spreadsheet that's outdated on delivery, and
                needs to be repeated every reporting cycle. Federation is live and continuous.</p>
