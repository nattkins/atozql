    <h1 class="case-question">"Is this the same customer?"</h1>
    <p class="case-lede">A global bank runs separate systems for retail, corporate, compliance, and custody. The same entity appears differently across each division. When regulators ask about exposure to a sanctioned entity, the answer requires correlating identities across systems that were never designed to talk to each other.</p>

    <h2>The Sanctions Screening Problem</h2>
    <p>When a bank receives a sanctions alert, the compliance team needs to answer: does this entity have exposure across the entire bank? The retail division has a customer record. Corporate banking has a counterparty record. Custody has a beneficial owner record. The AML system has a screening hit. These are four different systems with four different identifiers, four different data models, and four different definitions of what constitutes a 'match'.</p>
    <p>Today, an analyst manually searches each system, copies data into a spreadsheet, and attempts to correlate the results. It takes days. Regulators expect hours.</p>
    <h2>What Federation Reveals</h2>
    <p>ZQL queries all four systems simultaneously using the compliance team's natural question: 'Show me all exposure to entity X.' Each system returns what it knows using its own terminology. The correlation engine matches entities across systems without requiring anyone to agree on what 'customer' means. The analyst sees the complete picture — often for the first time — with full provenance showing which system contributed each fact.</p>
    <div class="highlight"><p>When 'customer' means different things in retail, corporate, and compliance — that's not a data quality problem. That's operational intelligence. The regulator doesn't care about your data model. They care about your exposure.</p></div>
    <h2>DORA and Operational Resilience</h2>
    <p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act requires 50,000 EU financial entities to demonstrate they can answer questions about their ICT dependencies, third-party risk, and operational continuity. These answers span vendor systems, risk registers, and infrastructure maps that were never designed to be queried together.</p>
    <p>Federation provides the architecture. The regulatory deadline provides the urgency.</p>
